# challenge8
Ticket machine


## Description
My solution to challenge 8 from course "Python Masters: 16 Days to Learn Python Programming".

Simple program simulating ticket machine in pharmacy.
At the entrance client chooses one of the available areas: perfumes, medicines, cosmetics.
Ticket machine returns ticket with number and informs that staff of pharmacy will be soon to help with shopping.
